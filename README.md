# Backend Assignment statement

We need to design a system allowing verified users to upload sensitive data in the form of large files. To this end, we'd want to do the following

  1.	As a user, I should be able to login on the platform using email address and password.
  2.	As a logged-in user, I should be able to see a list of all the files that I have uploaded. This list should be private and not visible to other users on the    platform or to external parties.
  3.	As a logged-in user, I should be able to delete an already uploaded file.
  4.	As a logged-in user, I should be able to upload a new file while specifying some additional info such as a title, description, etc. Once uploaded, the platform should figure out the file type and optionally compress it for storage. The file size could be anything upto 1GB.
  5.	As a logged-in user, I should be able to share one of my files publicly using a tiny URL obtained from the system.
